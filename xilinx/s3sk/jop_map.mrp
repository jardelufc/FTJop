   signal "cpm_cpu_cmp_mem_cmp_crc_state_len_mux0000<6>" which will be trimmed.
   See the trim report for details about why the input signal will become
   undriven.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:864 - The following Virtex Blockram(s) is/are being retargeted to
   Virtex2 Blockram(s). This will waste 75% of Virtex2 Blockram capacity. To
   obtain better utilization, Please re-run memory generator to retarget to
   Virtex2 Blockram modules:
   RAMB4_S16_S16 symbol
   "cpm_cpu_cmp_core_cmp_stk_cmp_ram_cmp_xram_block_cmp_ram_0" (output
   signal=cpm_cpu_cmp_core_cmp_stk_ram_dout<15>),
   RAMB4_S16_S16 symbol
   "cpm_cpu_cmp_core_cmp_stk_cmp_ram_cmp_xram_block_cmp_ram_1" (output
   signal=cpm_cpu_cmp_core_cmp_stk_ram_dout<31>)

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:863 - The following Virtex BUFG(s) is/are being retargeted to
   Virtex2 BUFGMUX(s) with input tied to I0 and Select pin tied to constant 0:
   BUFGP symbol "clk_BUFGP" (output signal=clk_BUFGP),
   BUFG symbol "cpm_cpu_cmp_mem_cmp_crc_Comp_0_0_not0000_BUFG" (output
   signal=cpm_cpu_cmp_mem_cmp_crc_Comp_0_0_not0000),
   BUFG symbol "cpm_cpu_cmp_mem_cmp_crc_D2_3_and0000_BUFG" (output
   signal=cpm_cpu_cmp_mem_cmp_crc_D2_3_and0000),
   BUFG symbol "cpm_cpu_cmp_mem_cmp_ham_top_cache4bits_reg_wr_en_BUFG" (output

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  10 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic reported below is either:
   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

The signal "cpm_cpu_cmp_mem_cmp_crc_state_len_mux0000<6>" is unused and has been
removed.
The signal "cpm_cpu_cmp_mem_cmp_crc_state_len_mux0000<9>" is unused and has been
removed.
The signal "cpm_cpu_cmp_mem_cmp_crc_state_len_mux0000<9>_map19" is unused and
has been removed.
The signal "cpm_cpu_cmp_mem_cmp_crc_state_len_mux0000<6>_map19" is unused and
has been removed.
The signal "N11920" is unused and has been removed.
The signal "N11921" is unused and has been removed.
The signal "N11922" is unused and has been removed.
The signal "N11923" is unused and has been removed.
The signal "N11924" is unused and has been removed.
The signal "N11925" is unused and has been removed.

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
