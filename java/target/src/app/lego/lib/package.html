Provides interfaces to the JOP Lego board periphery.
<p>
The package uses the Native.rd() and Native.wr() instructions provided by the JOP 
processor to communicate with the VHDL counterpart.
The VHDL counterpart is realized as a (simple) 
<a href="http://www.opencores.org/projects.cgi/web/simpcon/overview">SimpCon</a> slave.
The slaves top level entity is contained in vhdl/scio/sc_lego.vhd, and instantiated as 
jop/scio/sc_lego.
<p>
Conventions:
