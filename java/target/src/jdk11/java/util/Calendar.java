/**
 * This class is an abstract base class for Calendars, which can be used to
 * convert between <code>Date</code> objects and a set of integer fields which
 * represent <code>YEAR</code>, <code>MONTH</code>, <code>DAY</code>,
 * etc. The <code>Date</code> object represents a time in milliseconds since
 * the Epoch. <br>
 * 
 * This class is locale sensitive. To get the Object matching the current locale
 * you can use <code>getInstance</code>. You can even provide a locale or a
 * timezone. <code>getInstance</code> returns currently a
 * <code>GregorianCalendar</code> for the current date. <br>
 * 
 * If you want to convert a date from the Year, Month, Day, DayOfWeek, etc.
 * Representation to a <code>Date</code>-Object, you can create a new
 * Calendar with <code>getInstance()</code>, <code>clear()</code> all
 * fields, <code>set(int,int)</code> the fields you need and convert it with
 * <code>getTime()</code>. <br>
 * 
 * If you want to convert a <code>Date</code>-object to the Calendar
 * representation, create a new Calendar, assign the <code>Date</code>-Object
 * with <code>setTime()</code>, and read the fields with
 * <code>get(int)</code>. <br>
 * 
 * When computing the date from time fields, it may happen, that there are
 * either two few fields set, or some fields are inconsistent. This cases will
 * handled in a calendar specific way. Missing fields are replaced by the fields
 * of the epoch: 1970 January 1 00:00. <br>
 * 
 * To understand, how the day of year is computed out of the fields look at the
 * following table. It is traversed from top to bottom, and for the first line
 * all fields are set, that line is used to compute the day. <br>
 * 
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  month + day_of_month
 *   month + week_of_month + day_of_week
 *   month + day_of_week_of_month + day_of_week
 *   day_of_year
 *   day_of_week + week_of_year
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The hour_of_day-field takes precedence over the ampm and hour_of_ampm fields.
 * <br>
 * 
 * <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This can differ for non-Gregorian calendar. <br>
 * 
 * To convert a calendar to a human readable form and vice versa, use the
 * <code>java.text.DateFormat</code> class. <br>
 * 
 * Other useful things you can do with an calendar, is <code>roll</code>ing
 * fields (that means increase/decrease a specific field by one, propagating
 * overflows), or <code>add</code>ing/substracting a fixed amount to a field.
 *
