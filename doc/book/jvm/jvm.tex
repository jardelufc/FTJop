\section{JVM Architecture}

This section presents the details of the implementation of the JVM on
JOP. The representation of objects and the stack frame is chosen to
support JOP as a processor for real-time systems. However, since the
data structures are realized through microcode they can be easily
changed for a system with different needs. For example: to simplify a
compacting GC a handle to an object can be implemented by changing
the microcode of \code{getfield}, \code{putfield} and \code{new}.

\subsection{Runtime Data Structures}

Memory is addressed as 32-bit data, which means that memory pointers
are incremented for every four bytes. No single byte or 16-bit
access is necessary. The abstract type reference is a pointer to
memory that represents the object or an array. The reference is
pushed on the stack before an instruction can operate on it. A null
reference is represented by the value 0.

\subsubsection{Stack Frame}

On invocation of a method, the invoker's context is saved in a newly
allocated frame on the stack. It is restored when the method returns.
The saved context consists of the following registers:

\begin{description}

\item[SP:] Immediately before invocation, the stack pointer
    points to the last argument for the called function. This
    value is reduced by the argument count (i.e. the arguments
    are consumed) and saved in the new stack frame.

\item[PC:] The pointer to the next bytecode instruction after the invoke
instruction.

\item[VP:] The pointer to the memory area on the stack that contains
the locals.

\item[CP:] The pointer to the constant pool of the class from the invoking
method.

\item[MP:] The pointer to the method structure of the invoking method.

\end{description}

SP, PC and VP are registers in JOP while CP and MP are local
variables of the JVM. \figurename~\ref{fig_jvm_stack_invoke} provides
an example of the stack before and after invoking a method. In this
example, the called method has two arguments and contains two local
variables. If the method is a virtual one, the first argument is the
reference to the object (the \emph{this}-pointer). The arguments
implicitly become locals in the called method and are accessed in the
same way as local variables. The start of the stack frame
(\emph{Frame} in the figure) needs not to be saved. It is not needed
during execution of the method or on return. To access the starting
address of the frame (e.g. for an exception) it can be calculated
with information from the method structure:

\[Frame = VP + arg\_cnt + locals\_cnt\]

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Object Layout}

\figurename~\ref{fig_jvm_object} shows the representation of an
object in memory. The object reference points to the first instance
variable of the object. At the offset $-1$, a pointer is located to
access class information. To speed-up method invocation, it points
directly to the method table of the objects class instead of the
beginning of the class data. With the GC, the object is accessed via
one indirection, the handle (see Chapter~\ref{chap:rtgc}). The
pointer to the method vector base is part of the handle.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=\picscale]{jvm/jvm_object}
    \caption{Object format}
    \label{fig_jvm_object}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Array Layout}

\figurename~\ref{fig_jvm_array} shows the representation of an array
in memory. The object reference points to the first element of the
array. At the offset $-1$, the length of the array can be found.
With the GC the array is accessed via one indirection, the handle
(see Chapter~\ref{chap:rtgc}). The size fields is part of the
handle.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=\picscale]{jvm/jvm_array}
    \caption{Array format}
    \label{fig_jvm_array}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Class Structure}

Runtime class information, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig_jvm_class},
consists of the class variables, the dispatch table for the methods,
the constant pool and an optional interface table.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=\picscale]{jvm/jvm_class}
    \caption{Runtime class structure}
    \label{fig_jvm_class}
\end{figure}


The class reference is obtained from the constant pool when a new
object is created. The method vector base pointer is a reference
from an object to its class (see Figure~\ref{fig_jvm_object}). It is
used on \code{invokevirtual} with an index retrieved from the
constant pool. A pointer to the method structure of the current
method is saved in the JVM variable MP. The method structure, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig_jvm_method}, contains the starting address
and length of the method (in 32-bit words), argument and local
variable count and a pointer to the constant pool of the class.
Since the constant pool is an often accessed memory area, a pointer
to it is kept in the JVM variable CP.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=\picscale]{jvm/jvm_method}
    \caption{Method structure}
    \label{fig_jvm_method}
\end{figure*}


The interface table contains references to the method structures of
the implementation. Only classes that implement an interface contain
this table. To avoid searching the class hierarchy on
\code{invokeinterface}, each interface method is assigned a unique
index. This provides constant execution time, but can lead to large
interface tables.

The constant pool contains various constants of a class. The entry
at index 0 is the length of the pool. All constants, which are
symbolic in the class files, are resolved on class loading or during
pre-linking. The different constant types and their values after
resolving are listed in \tablename~\ref{tab_jvm_const_pool}. The
names for the types are the same as in the JVM specification
\cite{jvm}.

    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule
        Constant type &  Description \\
        \midrule

\subsubsection{Class Initialization Issues}
\label{para:restrict:clinit}

According to \cite{jvm} the static initializers of a class C are
executed immediately before one of the following occurs: (i) an
instance of C is created; (ii) a static method of C is invoked or
(iii) a static field of C is used or assigned. The issue with this
definition is that it is not allowed to invoke the static
initializers at JVM startup and it is not so obvious when it gets
invoked.

It follows that the bytecodes \code{getstatic}, \code{putstatic},
\code{invokestatic} and \code{new} can lead to class initialization
and the possibility of high WCET values. In the JVM, it is necessary
to check every execution of these bytecodes if the class is already
initialized. This leads to a loss of performance and is violated in
some existing implementations of the JVM. For example, the first
version of CACAO \cite{cacao} invokes the static initializer of a
class at compilation time. Listing~\ref{lst:retrict:clinit} shows an
example of this problem.

\cmd{JOPizer} tries to find a correct order of the class initializers
and puts this list into the application file. If a circular
dependency is detected the application will not be built. The class
initializers are invoked at JVM startup.

\begin{lstlisting}[float,caption={Class initialization can occur very late},
label=lst:retrict:clinit]
    public class Problem {

        private static Abc a;
        public static int cnt; // implicitly set to 0

        static {
            // do some class initializaion
            a = new Abc();  //even this is ok.
        }

        public Problem() {
            ++cnt;
        }
    }

    // anywhere in some other class, in situation,
    // when no instance of Problem has been created
    // the following code can lead to
    // the execution of the initializer
    int nrOfProblems = Problem.cnt;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Synchronization Issue}

Synchronization is possible with methods and on code blocks. Each
object has a monitor associated with it and there are two different
ways to gain and release ownership of a monitor. Bytecodes
\code{monitorenter} and \code{monitorexit} explicitly handle
synchronization. In other cases, synchronized methods are marked in
the class file with the access flags. This means that all bytecodes
for method invocation and return must check this access flag. This
results in an unnecessary overhead on methods without
synchronization. It would be preferable to encapsulate the bytecode
of synchronized methods with bytecodes \code{monitorenter} and
\code{monitorexit}. This solution is used in Suns picoJava-II
\cite{pjProgRef}. The code is manipulated in the class loader. Two
different ways of coding synchronization, in the bytecode stream and
as access flags, are inconsistent. With \cmd{JOPizer} the same
manipulation is of the methods is performed to wrap the method code
in a synchronized block when the method is defined synchronized.
