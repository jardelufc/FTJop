This book is about JOP, the Java Optimized Processor. JOP began as
research project for a PhD thesis. JOP has been used in several
industrial applications and, due to the fact that it is an
open-source project, has a growing user base. This book is written
for all of you who build this lively community. The book is based to
some extent on the PhD thesis. For a long time the thesis, some
research papers, and the web site  have been the only available
documentation for JOP. A thesis is quite different to a reference
manual. Its focus is on research results and implementation details
are usually omitted. This book fills the gap and provides insight
into the implementation of JOP and the accompanying Java virtual
machine (JVM). It also gives you an idea how to build an embedded
real-time system based on JOP.
